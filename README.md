static blog is my attempt to write a A blog engine to generate static HTML blog from markdown documents. This tools uses [markdown2 python library](https://github.com/trentm/python-markdown2) to generate HTML files.

Later found there were plenty of static website generator, I **stopped** working in this project. and started using pelican and jeklly which fit my needs
